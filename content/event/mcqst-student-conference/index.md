abstract: One of the challenges in High-Energy Physics (HEP) is events
  classification, which is to predict whether an image of particle jets belongs
  to events being sought after or just background signals. Classical
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proven a powerful algorithm in
  image classification, including jets image. As quantum computers promise many
  advantages over classical computing, comes a question on whether quantum
  machine learning (QML) can give any improvement in solving the
  problem.<br><br>This project aims to demonstrate quantum machine learning's
  potential, specifically Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), in HEP
  events classification from image data. Although many previous works have tried
  to classify images with QCNN, none of them is fully quantum. They were still
  incorporating classical fully-connected layers after variational circuits.
  This project will be one of the first to try classifying images with a fully
  quantum implementation of QCNN and probably the first one to do so with
  particle jets images.
