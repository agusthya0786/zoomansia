abstract: The combination of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global
  Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used in the localization of
  autonomous cars. However, GNSS is highly dependent on external conditions and
  has a low sampling rate. In order to make the localization of autonomous cars
  more reliable in various external conditions, a virtual sensing system using
  Error-state Kalman Filter (ESKF) and Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN)
  approach is proposed in this paper. In this proposed system, DRNN served as a
  predictor for the location of an autonomous car. DRNN is applied due to its
  independency against the external conditions, the ability to learn, and also
  its faster sampling rate compared to the global navigation system.
  Implementation and testing of this new approach using the CARLA Simulator show
  that the proposed system could correct the deviation caused by the absence of
  absolute position measurement. With further developments and improvements,
  this alternative sensing method would be able to replace the existing GNSS and
  unlock the possibility for offline localization.
