title: Learning Human Touch Interaction with Convolutional Neural Networks
date: 2019-01-20T09:30:51.589Z
summary: This project is the works done during my research internship at
  \[Gentiane Venture's Laboratory](http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~gvlab/), Tokyo Univ.
  of Agriculture and Technology, Japan. The project is about using CNN to
  classify several types of touch interaction from humans by learning the data
  pattern from a force sensor.
