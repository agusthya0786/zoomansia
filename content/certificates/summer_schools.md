    description: >-
      * Received a series of lectures and lab sessions in quantum computing from researchers at IBM.
      * Finished 9 quantum programming exercises using Qiskit.
      * Finished the final project challenge on implementing Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm for calculating the ground state energy of the LiH molecule in less than 2 days. I mitigated the qubits and gates error by extrapolating the energy data points for several depths of the gate layer.
